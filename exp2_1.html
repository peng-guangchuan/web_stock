    <p>Leading <span class="blue">experts</span> <span class="green">warned</span> that COVID-19 cases may surge in fall and <span class="blue">winter</span>  in the <span class="blue">United States</span> as the pandemic has <span class="green">caused</span> over 200,000 deaths as of <span class="blue">Tuesday</span>.</p>

    <p> Months into the pandemic, the <span class="blue">United States</span> has currently <span class="green">recorded</span> more than 6.88 million <span class="green">confirmed</span> COVID-19 cases and over 200,500 deaths, according to the real-time count kept by Johns Hopkins University.</p>
        
    <p> Still, the actual numbers are <span class="green">believed</span> to be much higher due to testing shortages, many <span class="green">unreported</span> cases and other <span class="blue">data</span> issues.</p>
